            <div class="body"> <p>If you have a file named <code>options.txt</code> in the <code>app/</code> folder, you can set some configuration options for Scriptonit that you could not achieve from within your application. Omitting this file is allright; all settings have defaults. But if you don't want your users to be able to exit with Alt+F4, or want to change the default dimensions of the application window, here's how it's done. <em>(the ending comments are optional, thank you Captain Obvious)</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-less">Close on ESC                        yes             //  it's off by default; if on, app window will close on ESC
Initial window size                 900x500         //  you can give your app a window dimension on first start
Initial window position             100,100         //  if you want to start on a specific part of screen
Initial border style                none            //  usually sizable or none; sizable is the default
Maximum window size                 1200x800        //  don't let window grow bigger than this
Minimum window size                 300x200         //  don't let window shrink smaller than this
Always on top                       no              //  you can make your window stay-on-top
Remember window position            yes             //  whether to start at the last window position next time
Remember window size                yes             //  whether to start with the last window size next time
Follow document title changes       yes             //  you can change the window title from js (document.title)
Break on script errors              yes             //  whether to stop when there's a javascript error
Use web browser context menu        no              //  right-clicking will pop up the good old browser page menu
Use web browser hotkeys             no              //  things like F5 to refresh; also off by default
Use Scriptonit context menu         no              //  Scriptonit has its own context menu; enabled by default</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the file format is <em>very simple</em>, it probably doesn't need much explanation. However it's important to note that at least 3 spaces or a tab is required between the columns. (Makes sense btw) Also, there are some non-trivials:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No quotes needed</strong> - anything after the separator spaces will be considered as one string.</li>
<li><strong>Comments are tricky</strong> - you can start a line with <code>//</code>, but to append a comment, use 3+ spaces before <code>//</code>!</li>
<li><strong>AxB means A,B</strong> - when specifying coordinate pairs, you can use the letter <code>x</code> as a separator. </li>
<li><strong>Many ways to bool</strong> - you can say yes, no, true, false, on, off, enabled or disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all you need to know.</p> </div>
