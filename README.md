# Scriptonit

Scriptonit makes Windows application/tool development a breeze. You can use your HTML/JS/CSS skills to create an app, and it will run in a neat little window like any other program on your computer. There are demo projects available so you can see a bit of the full power of Scriptonit:

- **FolderSizes** - A directory tree size calculator with graphical bars
- **VoiceNote** - An audio note keeper/organizer to remember your ideas; quite complex for a demo!
- **CheatSheet** - A complete reference for Scriptonit itself; more convenient than the browser version
- **HelloWorld** - The bare minimum, also serves as a starting point for other projects

All of these are open source projects, and `ScriptonitLauncher.exe` is also free; however it's only provided as a Windows binary, the C# source code itself is not disclosed.

## How it works?

You create an application simply by copying HelloWorld to another folder, and rename the exe file. The simplest possible project looks like this:

```text
```
